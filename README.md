## Introduction
In the introduction section, you will find an overview of the purpose and scope of the statistical analysis, as well as background information on the World Cup and its significance.

## Analysis
The analysis section is divided into several subsections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the analysis.

## Data Pre-Processing
This subsection discusses the steps taken to preprocess the raw data before conducting the analysis, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming variables if necessary.

## Constructing a Linear Regression Model
Here, the process of constructing a linear regression model for predicting World Cup performance is described. It includes variable selection, model building, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Constructing a Scoring System
In this subsection, you will find the details of constructing a scoring system to assess the overall performance of teams in the World Cup. The methodology used for assigning scores and its interpretation will be explained.

## The Effect of Partitioning and Dissolving a Country on World Cup Performance
This section explores the impact of partitioning and dissolving a country on its World Cup performance. It investigates whether such events have a significant effect and presents the findings and analysis.

## Performance Differences in Group and Knockout Stages
In this part, two different approaches (Approach 1 and Approach 2) are presented to analyze performance differences between group and knockout stages of the World Cup.

### Approach 1
Approach 1 describes a specific methodology to determine a difference using total goals scored.

### Approach 2
Approach 2 describes a different methodology using a normailized home and away goal differential.

## Conclusion
The conclusion section summarizes the key findings and insights derived from the statistical analysis.
